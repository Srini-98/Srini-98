### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Srini-98/Srini-98** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on large language models for text correction and multi document summarization as an AI Researcher (natural language processing group) at National University of Singapore.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Controlnet techniques for stable diffusion and the effectiveness of prompting for large language models.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on generative AI projects that involve working with both text and multi modal systems.
- ðŸ’¬ Love to discuss the latest machine learning developments.
